Simulation code relating to study entitled, 'Analyses of 'change scores' do not estimate causal effects in observational data'

This R-code is offered as a companion to the article 'Analyses of 'change scores' do not estimate causal effects in observational data' by Peter WG Tennant and colleagues. The code was written by Peter Tennant and Mark Gilthorpe with input from Johannes Textor. 

The code generates CSV files in the current directory. These CSV files contain the results of all simulations reported in the paper (Tennant et al 2020). The file whose name starts with "final-" contains the numbers reported in Table 1 in the manuscript. The numbers in the manuscript were generated using 100000 replicates, but we have reduced this here to 1000 for ease of testing.
